       <p>Iceland was first settled in the 9th and 10th century by Scottish and Irish settlers and thus ruled itself effectively until the tiny island was conquered by Norway and Denmark some 300 years later. The country boasts the world's oldest continuously operating legislative assembly, the althingi. Iceland, although limited in resources due to its size, is home to first-rate literary, longevity, and social cohesion by world standards.</p>

       <p>Reykjavik is the capital and largest city of Iceland, located on the southern shore of Faxaflói Bay. Steam from hot springs in the region is said to have inspired Reykjavík's name, which loosely translates to Smokey Bay. Its latitude of 64°09' N makes it the world's northernmost capital city. </p>

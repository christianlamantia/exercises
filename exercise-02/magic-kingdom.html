    <h2>Lands</h2>
        <body>
            <p>Magic Kingdom is divided into six themed "lands." It is designed like a wheel, with the hub in front of Cinderella Castle. Pathways spoke out from the hub across the 107 acres (43 ha) of the park and lead to these six lands. The Walt Disney World Railroad circles around the entire 1.5-mile (2.4 km) perimeter of the park and makes stops at Main Street, U.S.A., Frontierland, and Fantasyland.</p>
        </body>
    <h3>Main Street, U.S.A.</h3>
        <body>
         <p>Symbolically, Main Street, U.S.A. represents the park's "opening credits," where guests pass under the train station (the opening curtain), then view the names of key personnel along the windows of the buildings' upper floors.</p>
         <p>Taking its inspiration from New England to Missouri, this design is most noticeable in the four corners in the middle of Main Street, where each of the four corner buildings represents a different architectural style.</p>
        </body>
    <h3>Adventureland</h3>
        <body>
         <p>Adventureland represents the mystery of exploring foreign lands. It is themed to resemble the remote jungles in Africa, Asia, the Middle East, South America and the South Pacific, with an extension resembling a Caribbean town square.</p>
        </body>
    <h3>Frontierland</h3>
        <body>
            <p>In Frontierland guests can relive the American Old West, from the romanticized cowboys and Native Americans, to exploring the mysteries of the Rivers of America.</p>
        </body>
    <h3>Liberty Square</h3>
        <body>
          <p>Liberty Square is inspired by a colonial American town set during the American Revolutionary War. The Liberty Belle Riverboat travels down the park's Rivers of America.</p>
        </body>

        <p>In the words of Walt Disney: "Tomorrow can be a wonderful age. Our scientists today are opening the door of the Space Age to achievements that will benefit our children and generations to come. The Tomorrowland attractions have been designed to give you an opportunity to participate in adventures that are a living blueprint of our future."</p>

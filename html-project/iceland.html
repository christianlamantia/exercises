Iceland, although limited in resources due to its size, is home to first-rate literary, longevity, and social cohesion by world standards.</p>

Steam from hot springs in the region is said to have inspired Reykjavík's name, which loosely translates to Smokey Bay. Its latitude of 64°09' N makes it the world's northernmost capital city. </p>
